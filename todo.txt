output powerup map

--Room Parsing--

handle CTOP/WAR entrance/exit
some branch rooms fail parsing
ruin_11 is marked as normal john (still?)

multi-part rooms, ruin_11_2, that one oregano room

branch-mid rooms (branchstarta nd branch end values)

TODO NEXT:
level_creation fails if johngutter and ancientcheese are parsed together, regardless of other levels
^ added force john on add twoway segment, kind of fixed but finding a john still kind of fails,
^ has trouble connecting to ruin 11 john, why?

^ entrance_6 BE creates twoway to ONLY ruins_8 when it should allow twoway to entrance john
^ the logic of removing segments in step_back() might not be removing the right one or enough of them
^ and the type of segment it tries to add afterwards might not match


parse crustcove leads to A not in G error

add entrance seg
ruin_1 >  [ ruin_8, entrance_5,  John:  ]
     more seg
     add branch seg
ruin_1 > entrance_5 >  [ entrance_6,  John:  ]
     more seg
     add twoway seg
ruin_1 > entrance_5 > entrance_6 >  [ ruin_8,  John:  ] //Line A
     more seg
     add branch seg
ruin_1 > entrance_5 > entrance_6 >  [ ruin_8,  John:  ] //Line B
     remove seg (fail)
ruin_1 > entrance_5 >  [  John:  ] //Line C
     add twoway seg
ruin_1 > entrance_5 >  [  John:  ]
     remove seg (fail)

SOLUTION:
The problem is this. When we fail to find any new path from a potential room in [], we step back,
For example, in Line A, we choose ruin_8, in B we have failed to find something from ruin_8 !!TODO: why not ruin_11? (maybe necessary room used already?)
In Line C, we step back, erasing the chosen entrance_6
BUT!
the only failure was from entrance_6 to ruin_8 (and any other similar rooms that can match)
entrance_6 might be able to link to a different kind of room with a different type of entrance with a different path to that

SO what we need to do is try entance_6 with dfferent paths until we have consumed all possible entrance types for the next segment
